Complete new PSU circuit
Removed both buck converters --> LDO's MIC29302 and  BD50HC5MEFJ
Input voltage now 6.5V

ATTiny85 U51: connected +3V3A
Pin1 U51 ATTiny85 disconnected from MUXOUT pin30 U54, pin 5 U51 from MUXOUT pin30 U53

Lib element Q31 and Q32 EMG1 changed to TO25-5

Extra 68ohm R19 parallel L2 (drain SBB3089) to avoid oscillations
Footprint both zenerdiode changed to 0805

Add extra 4K7 pullup resistor R37 from PTT to 6.5V
Zener D36 changed to 5V1.
ICSP J52 connector footprint changed to SMD

To get more RX gain, optional U6 PGA103 can be replaced by MGA85675, extra R20 in series drain

Modified IF input can now handle 5W

To improve the -5V stabilization:
- Change the supply voltage from 6.5V into 7.5V. But now a small heatsink is required for U32 and U33
- Change C38 and C40 into 22uF e.g. 22uF 10V 0805 Mouser 81-GRM21BR61A226ME1L

To better get +6V on "+6 TX":
Change R44 from 200E into 180E
