How I did a first time test and measured a new Wavelab 24GHz add-on module.

I use a step by step approach:
- The pinstrips J2, J3 and J4 I only mount afterwards.
- Optically check if everything is present and well soldered.

Supply:
In RX, PTT open, high on pin 1 J32
-  +5V on C42
-  +5V on C43
- +3V3 on C57
-  -5V on C45
in TX mode, PTT short to ground, and pin 9 and 10 of J2 temporarily short circuited to simulate the RF module .
-  +6V on C41
-  +5V on C44

PTT switching:
In RX:
C12 and C22: 0V
C11 and C23: 5V
In TX:
C12 and C22: 5V
C11 and C23: 0V

In circuit programming U51:
Or directly upload HEX files or compile and upload.
Arduino IDE setting for compiling: Board "ATtiny25/45/85", Processor "ATtiny85", Clock "internal 1MHz"
Connect AVRISP MKII to J52
Ensure both U53 and U54 are powered: JP51 and JP52 closed.
Leave JP53 and JP54 always open

Test ADF4351's U53 and U54:
- Test with a multimeter in ohms if U53 and U54 are soldered correctly: 
    - Open pins: With a multimeter in the diode range, the plus terminal to ground and the other to a connected component: e.g. C or R you can measure if the pin is connected. Example: on C64 and C66,connected to pin 23 U54, you should measure ~~0.2V. 
- Check also short circuits: e.g. no short circuit between pin 23 C64 and  pin 24 C68. 
- Measure currents of U53 and U54 on JP51 and JP52, if OK short both jumpers JP51 and JP52 you can expect 71mA no code loaded 88mA code loaded
- with a DC voltmeter I usually check all DC values on all pins of U53 and U54, tapping on connected components. But perhaps this step is only needed to find fault.
- Ensure U51 is programmed
- Ensure 10MHz reference is connected and arrives at inputs of U53 and U54
- Connect supply; after 1 second first lock indication should switch on 500ms later also the other.
- 1807MHz should be present at pin 17-18 J2
- Check U1: connect a current meter between pins 1 and 2 from JP1: you should expect a current of ~~ 55 mA, if OK short JP1
- 1932MHz (case IF 432MHz) should be present on C6

Test 2364MHz TX:
Place module in TX, PTT short to ground
- Check U5: connect a current meter between pins 1 and 2 from JP3: you should expect a current of ~~ 55 mA, if OK short JP3
- 2364MHz should be present on pin 3-4 J3 (As test stimulus I usually connect +2dBm 432MHz on C8, and measure +1dBm on 2364MHz)

Test RX:
Place module in RX, PTT open
- Check U6: connect a current meter between pins 1 and 2 from JP4: you should expect a current of ~~ 15 mA (case MGA-86576), if OK short JP3-  
- As test stumulus I insert -20dBm 2364MHz (e.g. from a Pluto) on pin 13-14 J4 and I measure RX gain ~4dB 432MHz on J1

Add-on module current consumption:
- RX mode: ~~300mA
- TX mode: ~~335mA

Finally I mount the pinstrips and mate with the RF module.
Then step by step I verify the currents via the solder jumpers and close them.
